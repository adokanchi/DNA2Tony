| not sure   | in class (30min) |                                                                                                                                   Discussed various algorithms with other students. The best one *seems to be* some sort of binary search-like cutting algorithm that splits the DNA sequence into chunks and tries to reduce these chunks to a size smaller than an already-seen STR run. The specifics of how this would work are still being discussed. |
| October 14 |     9-9:30am     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Did a lot more talking about algorithms in class. Settled on a few possibilities around converting each character to binary and finding repeats from there. |
| October 14 |    9:30-10am     |                                                                                                                                                                                                             Began coding the algorithm above. Can't really talk about specifics here because it's still shaping up. But it will be searching through the dna sequence linearly, storing each place where a STR starts, and checking that map to find runs. |
| October 14 |   8:15-8:45pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Finished coding the algorithm. It loops through the DNA sequence and stores all the indices where a STR starts. Then, it loops through that map backwards to find the longest run. Currently not working and returning 0 for everything. |
| October 14 |   8:45-9:15pm    | Figured out the issue that made everything return 0 (shifting was not done properly, which made all the comparisons after the first pretty much guaranteed to be false). All test cases are being passed, although I'm not sure if I'm really passing testLongest, as it keeps saying it doesn't have enough memory to create a string. It's still green, and IDK how to fix that, so I'm happy (and I'm almost certain I'd get the right result anyways). |
| October 14 |   9:20-9:50pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Got rid of a method that wasn't really doing anything (modified the code a little to get rid of it), added comments. IDK how to actually improve the algorithm itself, so I'm making a few small changes before I ship it out. |
| October 15 |  10:45-11:00am   |                                                                                                                                                                          Talked to Cody, who said I can remove a zero in the testLargest tester file to fix the memory issue. Also updated my code to capitalize all characters, since the testLargest sequences have lowercase letters. Passing 5/5 test cases with time to spare without any issues now. |
| October 21 |  11:15-11:45am   |                                                                                                                                              Updated the algorithm to not do a pass through at the end to compute the max. Instead, I do it while moving through the sequence for the first and only time. Also removed some redundant checks that came from my worry that overlaps would cause me to miss STR sequences, which was not actually the case. |
