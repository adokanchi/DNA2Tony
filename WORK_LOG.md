| October 14 | 9-9:30pm  |                                                                                    Did a lot more talking about algorithms in class. Settled on a few possibilities around converting each character to binary and finding repeats from there. |
| October 14 | 9:30-10pm | Began coding the algorithm above. Can't really talk about specifics here because it's still shaping up. But it will be searching through the dna sequence linearly, storing each place where a STR starts, and checking that map to find runs. |
| Oct14      | 815-845pm |      Finished coding the algorithm. It loops through the DNA sequence and stores all the indices where a STR starts. Then, it loops through that map backwards to find the longest run. Currently not working and returning 0 for everything. |
