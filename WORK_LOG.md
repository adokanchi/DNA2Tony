Settled on a few possibilities around converting each character to binary and finding repeats from there. |

Can't really talk about specifics here because it's still shaping up. But it will be searching through the dna sequence linearly, storing each place where a STR starts, and checking that map to find runs. |

It loops through the DNA sequence and stores all the indices where a STR starts. Then, it loops through that map backwards to find the longest run. Currently not working and returning 0 for everything. |
| October 14 | 8:45-9:15pm | Figured out the issue that made everything return 0 (shifting was not done properly, which made all the comparisons after the first pretty much guaranteed to be false). All test cases are being passed, although I'm not sure if I'm really passing testLongest, as it keeps saying it doesn't have enough memory to create a string. It's still green, and IDK how to fix that, so I'm happy (and I'm almost certain I'd get the right result anyways). |
